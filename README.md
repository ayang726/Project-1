Problem: Children with Autism have limited motor skills. Having physical therapist demonstrate simple movements and asking the child to imitate can greatly improve the basic motor functionality of a child. Unfortunately there are limited technology resources out there to help fascilitate this process. We want to create an simple and engaging experience for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder to practice basic motor skills.

Positive reinforcers are very important in the process of developing motor skills for children with Autism. As they successfully complete a task, in this case, imitation of a movement, a positive audio/visual rewards will be displayed on screen as reinforcement of the accomplishment.

### User Story
* As a *child*, I want to be able to *watch a video of simple movement* so I can *imitate and practice basic motor skills*
* As a *child*, I want to be able to *record my movement from a camera* so that *I can share it with my PT for reivew*
* As a *child*, I want to be able to *receive audio/visual feedbacks* so that I have *positive reinforcement from what I accomplished*
